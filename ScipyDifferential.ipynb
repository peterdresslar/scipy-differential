    "# Differential Equation Solving with SciPy\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the differences in differential equation solving techniques offered by the Python [SciPy](scipy.org) package. There are two primary approaches in SciPy:\n",
    "1. The older `scipy.integrate.odeint` function\n",
    "2. The newer `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we should mention that there is an accessible and comprehensive Python math text from UCBerkeley called [Python Numerical Methods](https://pythonnumericalmethods.studentorg.berkeley.edu/notebooks/Index.html). Chapter 22 is called \"[Ordinary Differential Equation - Initial Value Problems](https://pythonnumericalmethods.studentorg.berkeley.edu/notebooks/chapter22.00-ODE-Initial-Value-Problems.html),\" and it might be pointed out that the difference between the two is that Initial Value Problems supply starting conditions to the Ordinary Differential Equations so that they can be solved with a unique numerical functions.\n",

    "The Lorenz system is a set of three coupled, nonlinear differential equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\frac{dx}{dt} &= \\sigma(y - x) \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dy}{dt} &= x(\\rho - z) - y \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{dz}{dt} &= xy - \\beta z\n",
    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ (sigma) is the Prandtl number\n",
    "- $\\rho$ (rho) is the Rayleigh number\n",
    "- $\\beta$ (beta) is related to the physical dimensions of the system\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic parameter values are $\\sigma = 10$, $\\rho = 28$, and $\\beta = 8/3$, which produce the famous \"butterfly\" strange attractor.\n",
